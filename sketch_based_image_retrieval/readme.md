# Research Progress log:
1. 05/20/2016 Read the paper The Sketchy Database: Learning to Retrieve Badly Drawn Bunnies", play around with Sketchy database
2. 06/07/2016 Attempt to pretrain Googlenet (which will be later used for joint training sketches and images) on Sketchy database image branch, fail with 25% accuracy. 
3. 06/20/2016 Attempt to pretrain Googlenet on Imagenet, fail because of lack of storage and computational power. 
4. 07/10/2016 Start convolutional neural network literature summary to find a feasible method to train on my mac
5. 08/15/2016 Decide to take a new approach: Use homogeneous Sketch-a-net on image edgemapes and sketches
6. 08/20/2016 Generate edgemap
7. 08/25/2016 Email original researcher regarding stroke order information
